# Push Off
Timer apple watch app built for runners

Instead of starting a workout after a 3 second timer, it starts when you lift your finger off of your watch. This is ideal for cross country racing as it's far more natural.

Also allows setting number of laps and goal time, then displays a progress bar of how far into each lap you should be, and vibrates your wrist when you're supposed to be finished with each lap. These vibrations occur even when the app is not visible, so you can flip your wrist downwards and the vibration will still occur. Also includes a 5K mode which vibrates at pace for 1, 2, 3, and 3.125 miles.

This includes preliminary Apple HealthKit support, will add GPS tracking for Series 2 + at some point in the future.

Please contact me if you'd like to participate in the TestFlight beta.
